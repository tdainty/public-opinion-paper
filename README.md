# public-opinion-paper
Initial Paper for Solt's "Comparative Public Opinion" Seminar - Fall 2024
"Test Iteration from RStudio - 10.21.24"
Test iteration from GitHub - 10.21.24

Note to self on the RStudio to GitHub connection from "happygitwithr.com": 
Do work somewhere: locally or on GitHub. Commit it (check the "staged" button beforehand"). 
Push it or pull it, depending on where you did the work, but get local and remote “synced up”. Repeat.
